    <h2>Bicol Express is a spicy pork stew cooked in coconut milk which is definitely 
        one of the most popular dishes among Filipinos.</h2>

        <p>Bicol Express has it's funny, if not weird, name from the train that travels 
            the Naga(Bicol)-Manila route. I don't really know why they chose to call it 
            after the train but it definitely deserves to carry the name of the province 
            of Bicol. Known in the Philippines for a lot of things such as the perfect 
            coned, Mayon volcano, Pili nuts and, of course, for their love of spicy food.</p>
        <p>There is a dispute, though, that is yet to be settled as to the real inventor 
            of this unique dish. There are some who say that Bicol Express was actually 
            invented by a Filipino food icon, Cely Kalaw, in her restaurant in Malate, 
            Manila. And that it was only inspired by the Bicolano cuisine since Cely is 
            not from Bicol but from Laguna. Of course, the Bicolanos are also staking 
            their claim that it is indeed originally from Bicol only known in a different 
            name, Gulay na lada (vegetable with chili) or Sinilihan.</p>
