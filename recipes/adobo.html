    <h2>The word adobo originates from the Spanish word “adobar,” which means to marinate. </h2>

        <p>So adobo is actually more a cooking method than a type of food. Adobo can be used 
        to flavor all kinds of meat, seafood, vegetables, and tofu. It makes any plain or 
        bland dish dance on your tastebuds.</p>

        <p>When you make pork adobo, you’re simply cooking and simmering a cut of pork in a base 
        of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and black peppercorns. The correct ratio of vinegar 
        and soy sauce is key to a delicious adobo, otherwise the taste can be dramatically 
        altered and off-putting.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 3-pound slab of pork belly, boneless and skin on, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Marinade:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced (about 3 tablespoons)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse prepared pork belly and drain well. Place it in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add all the marinade ingredients into the mixing bowl and stir well. Make 
                sure that all pork belly pieces are coated with the marinade. Cover and 
                place in the fridge for at least an hour. Marinate overnight if desired.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, heat up a dutch oven, a wok, or a large sauté pan 
                over high heat, about 1 minute. Remove pork from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Transfer the marinated pork into the hot pan with marinade, sauté for 
                about 2 minutes, or until the pork is lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add water and bay leaves, bring to a boil. Switch to low heat and simmer 
                for 30-45 minutes, covered or until the pork is tender. Sprinkle with a 
                dash of salt to taste if needed. Serve over rice and pair with a green 
                leafy vegetable dish to round out your meal.</li>
